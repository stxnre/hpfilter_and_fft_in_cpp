# Time Series Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (in C++)

This repository contains code that performs Seasonal-Trend Decomposition on a time series, using the Hodrick-Prescott Filter and the Radix-2 Fast Fourier Transformation. I wrote these from scratch in C++ as an exercise. The implementations are contained within the folder `fft_hpfilter`, along with the executable (when compiled) that performs the time series decomposition.

The python scripts (to be written) will visualize the output of the C++ code.
