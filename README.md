# Time Series Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (in C++)

This repository contains code that performs Seasonal-Trend Decomposition on a time series. This is done through implementations of the Hodrick-Prescott Filter and the Radix-2 Fast-Fourier Transformation that are written in C++, contained within the folder `fft_hpfilter`. 

The python scripts (to be written) will visualize the output of the C++ code.
